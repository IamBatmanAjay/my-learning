There was a question on string related concept in which there was a long string in Which they asked to replace 
occurrence of certain word with another word and and also asked to remove certain words.

questions related to maths like vector, cartesian geometry, etc. Then at last he asked me to write a program in C++

prime number function, matrix array

1)Find nth Max No from array
2)Check Whether string is cyclic
3)2-3 Puzzles


Technical round which was mostly based on geometry and puzzles and few optimisation programs.
Then there will be the managerial round where the manager will go through all the papers and ask some program based and managerial questions.

write optimised code for prime numbers

puzzle of 3 boxes one contain red ball, one blue and one mixture of both, the labels of these boxes are not proper, how many minimum picks required to correct the label

prove angle subtended by a semicircle is a right angle

find angle between diagonals of a cube ==  cos-1(-1/3)

you are given a paragraph consisting of letters ,numbers and special case character you have to count the occurrence of each character in the optimized way.

->Difference between linked list and array and which is better ,why?
    Differenciate in terms of size, memory allocation, memory efficiency, exection time
    - array are stored in contiguous memory location whereas lists are not


Interviewed on 28-01-2022:
Questions asked on string manipulation in C way 
    - Delete words
    - count words
    - check if a word exists
Question from C++ 
    - Operator overloading
    - Memory allocation new vs malloc
    - memory allocation for variables in program
    - heap vs free store

In the end interview was concluded with a puzzle
