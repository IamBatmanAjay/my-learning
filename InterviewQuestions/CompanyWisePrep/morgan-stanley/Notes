ask somethings about project you did

First round is a 30~45 mins phone interview. Pretty standard question, self introduction, basic C++ concept, common Linux commands.

Find special charaters like digit and question mark in a string.
What is smart pointer?
Smart pointer implementation
Quick algorithm questions (time complexity, space complexity)
Other logical reasoning questions
Something like FizzBuzz, than create data structures, merge, create algorithms.
What is the difference between the exception handling in C and C++?
later they asked wbout principles like rule of 3 or rule of 5.

how do you implement a vector
What's XML?
the keywords mutable vs const
- How to implement a lock-free algorithm
- I haven't used virtual inheritance since a long while and forgot what it it about.


Recursion :

During recursion, there may exist a case where same sub-problems are solved multiple times.
Consider the example of calculating nth fibonacci number.
fibo(n) = fibo(n-1) + fibo(n-2)
ffibo(n-1) = fibo(n-2) + fibo(n-3)
fibo(n-2) = fibo(n-3) + ffibo(n-4)
.................................
................................
................................
fibo(2) = fibo(1) + fibo(0)

In the first three steps, it can be clearly seen that fibo(n-3) is calculated twice. If one goes deeper into recursion, he/she may find repeating the same sub-problems again and again.

Dynamic programming is a technique where you store the result of previous calculation to avoid calculating the same once again. DP is basically a memorization technique which uses a table to store the results of sub-problem so that if same sub-problem is encountered again in future, it could directly return the result instead of re-calculating it.
