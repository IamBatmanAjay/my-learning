Yocto Project Interview Questions:
-----------------------------------------


Yocto is an Open source Project and used to create custom Linux for embedded devices. This is part-1 of the Yocto interview Questions which surely gonna help you in your professional interviews. Here we are going to discuss the IMAGE_INSTALL variable, Variable assignment, DEPENDS, and RDEPENDS variable uses, etc...

What is difference between IMAGE_INSTALL += " packagename" and IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " packagename"?
Both variables are used to add the extra package to the image.
To avoid any ordering issue, use the IMAGE_INSTALL_append in conf/local.conf instead of IMAGE_INSTALL +=
Suppose you want to add strace in your image. so It is recommended to add the below code in conf/local.conf files.
IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " strace"
If you want to create your image recipe then it is preferred to use IMAGE_INSTALL variable to add the packages or package groups to the image.
Example: In recipe core-image-minimal-mtdutils.bb,IMAGE_INSTALL += "mtd-utils" variable is used to add MTD Utilities.

 
 
What is the default assignment Variable in the Bitbake Recipe?
In the Bitbake Recipe, the Variable is defined with "= " sign called the direct assignment.
Example: var = 10 --> value of var is equal to 10.
The Variable is defined with " ?= " sign called default assignment.
var1 ?=10
var2 ?= 20
var2 ?=30
The value of var1 would be 10.
The value of var2 would be 20 because it is previously defined so their value would retain.

How to read Bitbake Recipe variables

Note: To read the recipe variable, use this command bitbake -e {recipe} | grep ^variable

 
What is the difference between DEPENDS vs RDEPENDS variable in the Bitbake recipe?
When Bitbake starts building any software packages and that packages have some dependency on another package so these variables DEPENDS and RDEPENDS are used to resolve the dependency.

DEPENDS variable is used for the build time dependency. so dependent packages and libraries are required before build the actual package.
Example: coreutils_8.32.bb recipe depends on gmp and libcap recipe. so Bitbake first build the gmp and libcap package before coreutils.
DEPENDS = "gmp libcap"
Depends Variable in Yocto

 

RDEPENDS variable is used for run time dependency. so all the packages and libraries are required during the execution program on the target system.
Example: Recipe perf.bb is RDEPENDS on elfutils and bash recipes so in this case elfutils and bash should be available when perf executed on the target.
RDEPENDS_${PN} += "elfutils bash"

Now we are going to discuss the Build Process, bbclass files, PREFERRED_VERSION variable, bb utils function, and state cache use case, etc...

What are the steps required to build a custom Linux image using the Yocto Project?
The Yocto Project provides tools, metadata, and a build framework to create the custom Linux image for your target board.
You have to follow the below steps to building the image with the Yocto Project.
You need to install some tools on your host system to support the Yocto Project Development.
Download the Poky source code from the Yocto repository.
Setup the build environment by running the oe-init-build-env script from the Poky directory.
Select the machine (target board name) from local.conf file.
Run the bitbake command from the build directory to create the image.
What is the bbclass in the Yocto?
A bbclass file contains common functionality that is shared between the multiple recipes.
.bbclass is the extension of the class files.
Each meta-layer has a class directory that contains the .bbclass files.
# You can use bbclass in the recipe by inheriting the class file.
# autotools.bbclass is a class file present in meta directory.
inherit autotools
How to build a particular version of a software package in the Yocto Project when there is multiple version of recipe present.
By default, if multiple versions of the recipe present in the layer then Bitbake selects the latest version of the recipe.
Suppose you have multiple versions of linux-yocto recipe in your meta layer then you can select any version of the recipe with the below code.
Add this code in your local.conf file
# Select the particular version of the recipe 
PREFERRED_VERSION_package_name = “version”

#Here package_name is linux-yocto and version 4.14
PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto =	“4.14”

# Some time you need to add the "%" symbol to match with the version string
PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto =	“4.14%”
What is the bitbake utility function in the bitbake recipe?
bb.utils is the bitbake utility function and bb.utils.contains function is most commonly used in the bitbake recipe.
You can find the complete code of the bibake utility function from here
Basic Syntex of the bb.utils.contains function.
bb.utils.contains(variable, checkvalues, truevalue, falsevalue, d)
variable - Name of the variable
checkvalues - This argument is used to check the presence of checkvalues in variable value
truevalue - if checkvalues is a subset of variable then it returns the 3rd argument truevalue
falsevalue -- if checkvalues is not a subset of variable then return 4th argument falsevalue
d - the data store.
Example:
A hello_1.0.bb recipe contains the below code snippet and we are checking the var1 and var2 values using the bb.utils.contains function.
bb.utils.contains function

# if var1 and var2 value is correct then return True otherwise False
var1 = "10"
var2 = "hello"
foo1 = "${@bb.utils.contains('var1', '10', 'True', 'False', d)}"
foo2 = "${@bb.utils.contains('var2', 'hello', 'True', 'False', d)}"
foo3 = "${@bb.utils.contains('var1', '20', 'True', 'False', d)}"

# As per the above code we will get the below result.
foo1="True"
foo2="True"
foo3="False"
bb.utils.contains function output
What is shared state cache(sstate cache ) in Yocto Project?
It stores the intermediate files which are generated during the build process.
This sstate-cache directory is used to speed up the build process.
You can find this directory inside the build folder.
