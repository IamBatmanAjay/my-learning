SQL | CREATE
------------

There are two CREATE statements available in SQL:

    - CREATE DATABASE
    - CREATE TABLE

A Database is defined as a structured set of data. So, in SQL the very first step to store the data in a 
well structured manner is to create a database. 

The CREATE DATABASE statement is used to create a new database 
in SQL.
    CREATE DATABASE database_name;
    database_name: name of the database.

    Example Query: CREATE DATABASE my_database;
