SQL | SELECT Query
--------------------

With the SELECT clause of a SELECT command statement, we specify the columns that we want to be displayed 
in the query result and, optionally, which column headings we prefer to see above the result table.

The select clause is the first clause and is one of the last clauses of the select statement that the database 
server evaluates. The reason for this is that before we can determine what to include in the final result set, 
we need to know all of the possible columns that could be included in the final result set.


To fetch the entire table or all the fields in the table:
 SELECT * FROM table_name;
 example: SELECT * FROM Student

Query to fetch the fields ROLL_NO, NAME, AGE from the table Student:
 SELECT ROLL_NO, NAME, AGE FROM Student;

Query to fetch the fields ROLL_NO, NAME, AGE where AGE is greater than 20 from the table Student:
 SELECT ROLL_NO, NAME, AGE FROM Student WHERE AGE>20


Query to fetch the fields ROLL_NO, NAME, AGE where AGE is greater than 20 and Name is Ajay from the table Student:
SELECT ROLL_NO, NAME, AGE FROM Student WHERE AGE>20 AND NAME="Ajay"
