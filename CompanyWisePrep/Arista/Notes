Things to Prepare:


OS memory management, deadlocks, semaphores, mutex. Also questions on data structures and their implementations.
Knowledge of C pointer and reference, outcome of printf
Knowledge of array algorithm, finding
Programming Language, Problem-solving questions and coding

Few output questions related to static variables, format of printf function
Coding Question:
Q1: Given a very large number, which cannot be stored in usual data types. How will you store it and add one to it?

Q2: Given an sorted array of numbers, find the missing number in less than O(n)

O/P question related to pointers, static variables
Pass by value/reference, pointer arithmetic (know your pointers throughly)
How to design free function of your own?
How to count all objects instantiated by a class?
Runtime polymorphism in c++

Design phone book: search by name, phone number and print 10 most dialled numbers

Why BST cannot be used?
Comparison between bst and trie
Benefits of trie over bst except search optimisation
Time complexity in bst


-- linked list insertion from front
-- find bug in a method which need to return char pointer
-- how linux  pipe "|" works 
-- ipc
-- updating shared resources
-- find optimal way to find duplicate lines in a 20GB file with millions of line
